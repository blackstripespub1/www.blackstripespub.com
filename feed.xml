<p>The problem turns out to be an error caused by a change in the CUPS printer server making it not share USB printers very well anymore.</p>
<p>The fix requires adding an older protocol to your configuration settings. This can be done through the web interface on the Administration page under the Server section. Make sure BrowseRemoteProtocols also has CUPS listed next to it.</p>

                <h3>From the "Well, now that it affects me" department</h3>
<p>Christianity Today is <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2023/april/tennessee-erlc-brent-leatherwood-covenant-gun-proposal-lee-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reporting</a> that Brent Leatherwood, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission is concerned with gun violence. This follows the mass shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville where his children attend.</p>
<p>Leatherwood has had plenty of time to address this as he was previously the executive director of the Tennessee GOP; and now, with <span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">twenty percent of Tennessee's residents being Southern Baptist, he has those ears as well</span><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">. But his department was busy with other issues of morality and life. Maybe he thought the 2018 Southern Baptist resolution "</span><a href="https://www.sbc.net/resource-library/resolutions/on-gun-violence-and-mass-shootings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">On Gun Violence and Mass Shootings</a><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">" was enough, when it actually comes across as little more than "thoughts and prayers".</span></p>
<p>Solutions to gun violence have been a hard sell to those who have yet to suffer from it. Sadly, I guess we know what it's going to take to change things.</p>

<h3>Emotions reveal our values</h3>
<p><em>Emotions: Revealing Our Value Systems</em> is a practical look at emotions from the perspective of heart values. <a href="https://amzn.to/3A0iMPa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buy it on Amazon.com</a></p>
<p>Many people are driven by their emotions, making life decisions without carefully examining the deeper spiritual issues behind them. By understanding the three aspects of value system that produce our desires, we can improve our relationships and make decisions based on true spirituality.<br><br>In this book, special attention is given to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the connection between emotions and values</li>
<li>how to communicate your deepest desires</li>
<li>love, loneliness, and jealousy</li>
<li>sadness and happiness</li>
<li>anger and disgust</li>
<li>fear and hope</li>
<li>shame and regret</li>
<li>boredom and apathy</li>
<li>pride and envy</li>
</ul>
<h3>Discover your values</h3>
<p>Emotions powerfully affect our lives. We feel them especially deeply during the relational turning points of our lives: marriage, the birth of a child, a death. They are present with our greatest joys and sorrows.<br><br>Our relationships can be improved by discovering the proper use of emotions and by using our emotions to understand our desires and values. Better relationships begin with permanent change flowing from a loving heart. Once we understand our own values, we can communicate our deepest desires and understand those of the ones we love.<br><br>Learn the purpose of emotions along with explanations of what produces our most common emotional experiences, both positive and negative. Gain help for your personal, spiritual, and relational growth.</p>

<h3>God's Value System</h3>
<p>God's Value System develops the theology of understanding God and biblical issues in terms of relationship with God. <a href="https://amzn.to/3A0iMPa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buy it on Amazon.com</a><br><br>Jesus never intended the Gospel to be something that only affected life after death. His message of good news begins right now in this life. An inadequate understanding of the Gospel fails to bring the values of Christ's Kingdom into our lives. However, a true understanding of the relational blessings that God provides for us brings transformation to all of our relationships.<br><br>Here are a few of the ideas covered in this book:</p>
<ul>
<li>the basis for relationship with God</li>
<li>the relational nature of theology</li>
<li>the Gospel in its most basic and complete form</li>
<li>the failure of relationship through legalism</li>
<li>clearly defining the nature of worship and holiness</li>
<li>evangelism that focuses on value system</li>
<li>the primary purpose of prayer</li>
</ul>
<p>As you read this book, you will refocus your attention on what Jesus taught about his Kingdom, and what he declared to be good news.</p>
<h3>Relationship with God</h3>
<p>Relationships are based on what you have in common with another person, whether family, work, hobbies, or religion. Truly knowing a person, including God, is entirely dependent on knowing what that person values; and deepening relationship requires agreement and unity in what you value most. In order to have a good and meaningful relationship with someone, you must hold in common that which is most important to you. This is no different in our relationship with God. Relationship with God must be based on our adopting values that are like his, and removing from our lives anything we value that he does not. The only measure of Christian growth in Christ-likeness is how much we have become like him in terms of value system. Therefore, we must be sure we truly understand what God values. If we misunderstand God's value system, then we misunderstand who he is. If we do not know what God values, then we cannot be sure that we are even becoming like him.</p>
<h3>How can we know what God values?</h3>
<p>God has revealed his value system, although many have misunderstood or misrepresented it. Only through an examination of the Gospel of the Kingdom can we know God's value system. We must be very sure we understand the Gospel without adding or subtracting from it, because if we fail to clearly comprehend the teachings of Jesus, we will be severely hindered in knowing and becoming like him. God's value system is sacrificial love for the benefit of others, and it most looks like Jesus on the cross. If we are to be like him, we must understand this truth fully and seek to become like him in loving others sacrificially.</p>
